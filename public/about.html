<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Srestha Basak. I'm a really passionate and creative soul and love to be always involved in various activities. I'm an energetic person and light hearted who loves to be the goofiest friend in the friend's group. My passion is dancing and I got trained in bharatnatyam for 12 years. Other than this I also enjoy swimming and painting. I also journal sometimes as it gives me a lot of peace.</p>

<p>I just got started with web development and growing interest in it steadily. I have many aspirations. I am also an academic writer and do freelancing for the past 48 months in order to arrange my own pocket money. I'm a money minded person and is also very driven who can work hard to achieve the goal with consistency.</p>

<p>Looking forward to complete this course and be a Web developer.</p>
